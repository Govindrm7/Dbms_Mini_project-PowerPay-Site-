### <i>Automatic Electricity Bill Generation System</i>
We have made an Automatic Electricity Bill Generation System which when provided with login details of the customer or user, the customer can view the payable bill details along with personal, connection and meter details.<br>
The main two modules or components of this system are Frontend and Backend development:<br>
#### <b>Frontend:</b>
This involved creation of a website which we named <b>PowerPay</b>. The creation of website involved using various languages such as:
<ol type="1">
  <li>HTML
  <li>CSS
  <li>JavaScript
</ol>

#### <b>Backend:</b>
This involved creation of a database for storing details of customers and connecting the database with the website created. This was done using languages such as:
<ol type="1">
  <li>MYSQL
  <li>PHP
</ol>
